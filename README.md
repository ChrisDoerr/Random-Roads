# Random Roads

A simple HTML browser game. The player starts at the top left and drives through a labyrinth in order to exit the map at the bottom right.

I was just playing around with some ideas and this is to be considered nothing more than a just-for-fun prototype.

The maps are randomly generated (hence the title) and so far I haven't added a sanity check of any sorts. Meaning, it is quite possible that you end up with non-solvable maps. To compansate for that, the player gets 6 lives each time she or he enters a new level.
